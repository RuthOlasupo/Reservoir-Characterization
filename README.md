## üîç Project Overview

This project focuses on **reservoir characterization** to better understand the subsurface geology, and classification of facies through geological facies analysis. It combines **data-driven analysis, machine learning models, and visualization tools** to provide insights into the reservoir's facies.

### Objectives:
- Analyze subsurface data to identify key geological properties.
- Implement machine learning workflows for predicting facies type within a reservior
- Visualize reservoir properties using Python-based libraries.



## ‚ú® Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Includes statistical summaries and visualizations of reservoir data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements predictive models to classify facies.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Well-documented code and instructions for reproducibility.

## üìä Data Description
The data set comes from a University of Kansas class exercise on the Hugoton and Panoma gas fields.
The data set consists of seven features 
- (five wireline log measurements two indicator variables- last 2
- a facies label at half-foot depth intervals.(Shale ( Sandstone , Limestone etc)
In machine learning terminology, the set of measurements at each depth interval comprises a feature vector, each of which is associated with a class (the facies type).
- Gamma ray (GR)
- Resistivity (ILD_log10)
- Photoelectric effect (PE)
- Neutron-density porosity difference (DeltaPHI)
- Average neutron-density porosity (PHIND)
- Nonmarine/marine indicator (NM_M)
- Relative position (RELPOS)

### Sample Dataset Includes:
- **Geological Features**: Facies, Formation, Resistivity, Gamma Ray...
- **Location Information**: Well depth and Relative position.
