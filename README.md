## üîç Project Overview

This project focuses on **reservoir characterization** to better understand the subsurface geology, fluid distribution, and production potential of oil and gas reservoirs. It combines **data-driven analysis, machine learning models, and visualization tools** to provide insights into the reservoir's performance.

### Objectives:
- Analyze subsurface data to identify key geological and fluid properties.
- Implement machine learning workflows for predicting reservoir performance.
- Visualize reservoir properties using tools like Tableau and Python-based libraries.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Includes statistical summaries and visualizations of reservoir data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements predictive models to estimate production potential.
- **Visualization Tools**: Integration with Tableau for interactive dashboards.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Well-documented code and instructions for reproducibility.

---

## üíª Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data processing
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning
  - `streamlit` for web-based EDA applications
- **Visualization Tools**: Tableau
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub
